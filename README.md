This repository contains an example of incomplete error handling in Tcl file I/O operations, along with a solution. The original code lacks proper checks for file existence and other potential errors, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution demonstrates how to implement robust error handling using Tcl's built-in mechanisms.
